              Regarding the theme of renovation, the primary purpose of this
              projects is to examine the renovation of roofs on residential
              houses. The renovation process involves all activities from
              initiation of the project up to the finalization of the roof
              renovation of roof and cleaning up the site.
              <br />The second subject matter is linked to the notion of
              industrialization and digitalization and explores the innovative
              technologies which are emerging in the construction industry, and
              are transforming how products are being designed and produced.
