              Regarding the theme of renovation, the primary purpose of this
              projects is to examine the renovation of roofs on residential
              houses. The renovation process involves all activities from
              initiation of the project up to the finalization of the roof
              renovation of roof and cleaning up the site.
              <br />The second subject matter is linked to the notion of
              industrialization and digitalization and explores the innovative
              technologies which are emerging in the construction industry, and
              are transforming how products are being designed and produced.

              Investigation of knowledge from other domains aims to provide the
              answer to which methodologies and tools can be used for
              structuring domain knowledge.
              <br />Cross-domain knowledge encompasses the topics of knowledge
              acquisition, systems thinking, and data visualization.

            <p class="step-description">
              Exploration of the realm of domain knowledge focuses on describing
              how the process of renovating roofs is currently executed in
              practice. There are various types of roof renovation, expanding
              from only replacing roof tiles, to insulating the roof, to
              replacing the complete roof by installing modular roof elements to
              the existing structure, or to mounting additional elements on the
              roof, such as PV panels. The different intervention measures in
              the roof renovations are explored to provide the definition of the
              renovation process in this project.

              The introduction of Industry 4.0 to construction industry brought
              about by a myriad of various A&R technologies that could be
              considered for deployment in construction. Certain technologies
              are developed in other industries, some are developed specifically
              for construction, and they vary in technology readiness level, as
              well as feasibility for direct implementation in construction

              Cross-domain knowledge provides tools for the task of structuring
              domain knowledge. Structured representations of the phases in
              renovation process, as well as A&R technologies are the final

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Final Objective</h3>
            <p class="step-description">
              The designed framework addresses the connection between the
              domains of renovation process and A&R technologies that can be
              deployed in it. The effectiveness of analyzing the two fields
              within the domain knowledge in conjunction, rather than separate,
              is where the fundamental merit of this project resides. The
              interconnectedness of two fields shows that making changes in
              either of the fields requires the revision of the other one.
