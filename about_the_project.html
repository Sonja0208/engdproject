            <p class="about-description"> The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Renovation 4.0 is a project that is part of the Engineering Doctorate Program at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). It is established by the Smart Buildings & Cities (SB&C) Program at the Department of Built Environment at TU/e.</p>
            <p class="about-description"> Engineering Doctorate (EngD) program is a two-year technological designer program offered at TU/e to post-master students who would like to broaden their technical knowledge and accompany it with knowledge from various other fields, such as entrepreneurship, finance, system thinking, and so on. The program consists of two main parts running in parallel:
              <ul class="about-description list">
                <li class="list list-item">Post-master level education in the form of generic design projects and courses about design methods, entrepreneurship and professional skills, as well as several technical courses</li>
                <li class="list list-item">Individual design project in collaboration with a company</li>
              </ul>	
              </p>
              <p class="about-description">
              Regarding the individual design project, it is part of the One-Day Makeover project. The One-Day Makeover project addresses two main themes, which are named “Development of integrated arrangements for renovation” and “Industrialization and digitalization of the renovation process”. Individual design project is focused on the theme “Industrialization and digitalization of the renovation process”. The consortium's objective for this part of the project is to develop an industrial approach for a faster and cheaper renovation of existing homes in The Netherlands, particularly residential houses with a sloping roof. One of the ways how this can be tackled is by evaluating the possibility of automation in the renovation process. </p>
                <p class="about-description">The design challenge calls into question how the renovation process determines which A&R technologies can be deployed in it, as well as how the deployment of each technology could affect the current renovation processes. 
                </p> 
                <p class="about-description">The design challenge outlines few necessary functionalities and characteristics which the developed framework must encompass. The first design requirement is to represent the entire value chain in the process of renovation. The second design requirement highlights the analysis of A&R technologies in the construction industry that can be deployed in the renovation processes. The final requirement addresses the connection between the domains of renovation process and A&R technologies that can be deployed in it.
                </p> 
                <p class="about-description">The final outcome of the project is the design of a conceptual framework for the implementation of A&R technologies in renovation processes. The designed framework represents a visual tool for the possible user that wishes to evaluate the A&R technologies that can be implemented in some of the phases in the renovation process. Also, the framework can be used to organize ideas regarding the possible ways of improving the renovation processes.
