            <p class="about-description"> The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Renovation 4.0 is a project that is part of the Engineering Doctorate Program at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). It is established by the Smart Buildings & Cities (SB&C) Program at the Department of Built Environment at TU/e.</p>
            <p class="about-description"> Engineering Doctorate (EngD) program is a two-year technological designer program offered at TU/e to post-master students who would like to broaden their technical knowledge and accompany it with knowledge from various other fields, such as entrepreneurship, finance, system thinking, and so on. The program consists of two main parts running in parallel:
              <ul class="about-description list">
                <li class="list list-item">Post-master level education in the form of generic design projects and courses about design methods, entrepreneurship and professional skills, as well as several technical courses</li>
                <li class="list list-item">Individual design project in collaboration with a company</li>
              </ul>	
              </p>
              <p class="about-description">
              Regarding the individual design project, it is part of the One-Day Makeover project. The One-Day Makeover project addresses two main themes, which are named “Development of integrated arrangements for renovation” and “Industrialization and digitalization of the renovation process”. Individual design project is focused on the theme “Industrialization and digitalization of the renovation process”. The consortium's objective for this part of the project is to develop an industrial approach for a faster and cheaper renovation of existing homes in The Netherlands, particularly residential houses with a sloping roof. One of the ways how this can be tackled is by evaluating the possibility of automation in the renovation process. </p>
              <p class="about-description">
                The final objective of the EngD project is the design of a framework which describes implementation of automation and robotic (A&R) technologies in different phases within the process of renovation while considering the renovation process as one individual system. It takes into consideration the influence of renovation process on possible technologies that could be implemented, as well as evaluation of each technology and its functions that can be deployed in diverse contexts in renovation process.   
                </p>
                <p class="about-description">Main project themes are explored in this chapter, and two main topics are singled out, renovation process and domain of A&R technologies in construction industry, specifically the aim of their implementation in renovation projects. Those two topics represent the domain knowledge of this project. The design of the final objective is based on answering the following questions:
                </p> 
                  <ul class="about-description">
                    <li class="list-item">Which methodologies and tools can be used for structuring domain knowledge?</li>
                    <li class="list-item">How is the process of renovating roofs currently executed in practice?</li>
                    <li class="list-item">Which new A&R technologies can be implemented in the construction industry?</li>
                    <li class="list-item">How is the renovation process influencing the deployment of A&R technologies, and vice versa, and is there value in simultaneously analyzing the process of renovation and deployment of A&R technologies?</li>
                  </ul>
