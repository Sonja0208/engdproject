            The effectiveness of analyzing the two fields within the domain
            knowledge in conjunction, rather than separate, is where the
            fundamental merit of this project resides. The interconnectedness of
            two fields shows that making changes in either of the fields
            requires the revision of the other one. For the detailed
            clarification of this statement, the framework is described and its
            main characteristics are shown in the following paragraphs. The
            design of the framework is illustrated on page
            <strong>EXPLORE</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            Regarding section A, each phase within the renovation process is
            represented as a separate node (circle) and with the ID of the
            phase. The links between phases are defined based on requirements
            and functions of each phase, and represented as arc lines between
            the two nodes.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            As for section B, each A&R technology is also represented as a node,
            together with the ID of each technology. There are several types of
            links between A&R technologies, namely links defined by: requirement
            for other A&R technologies, requirement to other A&R technologies,
            benefits from other A&R technologies, and benefits provided to other
            A&R technologies. Each of the links is also depicted as an arc line
            between the nodes that constitute each A&R technology, and arc lines
            are represented with different colors.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            Section C represents the links between the fields of renovation
            process and A&R technologies. The links are depicted as lines
            between phase nodes and A&R technology nodes, and there are few
            different types of connections between the two fields.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            First type of connections is described based on the function of the
            phase, for which new A&R technology can be implemented for. New A&R
            technology that could be used in the phase is based on uniformity of
            function it performs and the function of the phase. With this type
            of connection, certain A&R technologies can be directly implemented
            in the renovation process, and the deployment of these A&R
            technologies in any of the phases necessitates that each of the
            technologies’ requirements must be met. Indeed, that is implied no
            matter the nature of the links between the phase and A&R technology
            that led to the conclusion for its possible implementation.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            The function of the A&R technology remains the same, no matter the
            context for which it is deployed. However, the context in which that
            technology could be deployed varies, and there are two types of
            contexts that need to be clarified.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            The first context in which A&R technology can be deployed for is the
            optimization of some of the phases. The functions of technologies
            are the same, but the context in which those are deployed dictate
            what kind of information is needed to be generated within the
            phases, and for that reason additional requirements must be defined
            for the phases. Those additional requirements for phases must be
            included if the technology is to perform its function properly and
            with the envisioned goal, which is to optimize the phase. With this,
            the second type of links is defined between the field of A&R
            technologies and field of phases.
          </p>
          <p class="about-description">
            The second context is the addition of a completely new task to some
            of the phases, and it describes the new use case for the A&R
            technology. In that case, implementation of novel and innovative
            technologies in renovation projects would be made possible, due to
            the proper use cases those technologies can serve, which haven’t
            existed before in the renovation process. It would be unreasonable
            to deploy technologies without any valid function those technologies
            can perform. That way, the overall renovation process should be
            revised and the potential of that new revision could offer advanced
            possibilities which haven’t been thought of before. This link then
            necessitates the additional requirements for the phase if some A&R
            technologies are to be implemented. It requires generation of new
            data and information, and creation of the tasks within the phase
            that can benefit from specific functions of those technologies. This
            described link constitutes the third type of the links between the
            field of A&R technologies and field of phases.
